# C-Project-10
 Open and read a file of integer pairs into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.  

So  4 9  11  4  5    would mean create an integer array size 4 and read into data[].   

 Write a routine that places these values into a binary tree structure.
 Then walk the tree “inorder”. 
 Print these values to the screen.
